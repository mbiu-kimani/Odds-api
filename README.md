Unified Bookmakers and Odds API
Welcome to the Unified Bookmakers and Odds API project!
This repository aims to create a comprehensive API that consolidates data from various bookmakers, 
providing a single, unified interface for accessing odds. Users can also contribute their own scraped data to enrich the API's dataset.

Introduction
The Unified Bookmakers and Odds API is designed to streamline the process of accessing odds from different bookmakers. By consolidating this data into a single API, we aim to provide a more efficient and standardized way for users to retrieve and use odds information. Additionally, this project encourages community contributions, allowing users to add new bookmakers and their odds, as well as their own scraped data.

Features
Unified API Interface: Access odds from multiple bookmakers through a single, standardized API.
Community Contributions: Open to contributions from the community to add new bookmakers and their respective odds data.
Data Scraping: Users can scrape odds data from various sources and contribute it to the API.
Extensibility: Designed to be easily extendable to accommodate new bookmakers and additional data points.
